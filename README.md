# Module 2 Final Project

The task is to use data from the King County housing market to make a model that can predict housing prices. In order to determine the most valuable ways to use this model I broke the questions of this project into three groups.

## When To Buy
What factors predict that a house is a good investment?
- Model v. Age grouped by other predictive variables
- Predict age of highest potential (when slope is highest positive, or zero and at the bottom)

- predicted Value over time
- what month should we buy?

## When To Sell 
What factors predict a house is at peak value?
- Model v. Age visual grouped by other predictive variables
- predict age of minimal potential (when slope is 0 and at the top)

## Valuation
After we've made a decision about buying or selling, how should we value the house in the market?

# Description of Data
The data contains 21597 entries with 21420 unique houses sold in the King County during 2014 and 2015. Sale prices in the set range from $78,000 to $7,700,000 with a mean of $540,296, median of $450,000 and standard deviation of $367,368. Houses in the sample range from brand new to 115 years old, with a mean age of 43.3 and standard deviation of 29.38 years.   

For this analysis the data was split into a train test split with a test size of .2. To allow for reproducablity, the random state used for the split was  

# Added Features
Based on the questions posed in the analysis. I chose to add an age feature 
I chose to add a distance to Seattle City Center feature
I chose to add a size relative to neighbors feature
